I extended my interactions with leavers over an approximately seven-year period through participant observations, interviews, immersion in primary documents from the LDS Church, and follow-ups telephone conversations and emails with participants. As is common for leavers of high-cost religions (see e.g., Davidson 2018; Cotee 2015), participants described how they had to pay attention to and address the ways that Mormonism treats doubters, questioners, and dissenters in order to trust their own experiences, despite the shaming and deflections offered by church leaders and Mormons in their families and communities.

Second, like all religious leavers, participants had to confront in some way both the truth claims and ethical imperatives of the LDS Church. I found that the specific doctrinal beliefs of Mormonism congealed into these twin issues—knowledge and ethics—and a concomitant set of conflicts and dissonances that leavers had to resolve. The specific ways that Mormonism frames both “truth” and “moral goodness” necessitated adjustments and revisions of thought and emotion in order to detach from them.

Armand Mauss’s foundational work argued for a three-part typology of “apostasy” that saw adherents leaving because of intellectual learning or disagreement, social conflict, and emotional disconnection, by which Mauss meant a rupture with the community caused by perceived hypocrisy (1969). Merlin B. Brinkerhoff and Kathryn L. Burke (1980) constructed a framework for understanding the contexts of leaving religion, where “disaffiliation involves both the dimensions of communal identification (or the feeling of belonging to a group) and religiosity (the embracing of a set of beliefs or doctrines)” suggesting that the dynamic relationship between how tightly connected to the group an adherent is and the degree to which they believe in the group’s claims channels and transforms their leaving experience. Brinkerhoff’s and Burke’s relational framework shows that a leaver’s reasons for quitting religion must be viewed relative to their level of devotion to the religion, and in turn raises the question of how individuals with differing levels of belonging and belief might have different reasons for leaving. My data in this study not only confirm Mauss’s theory, but per Brinkerhoff and Burke, they also flesh out the contextual specifics of how a deeply committed Mormon must confront more and different obstacles than do Mormons who are already marginal to the religious community.

A more recent book length work by E. Marshall Brooks, Disenchanted Lives (2018), examines the cultural and social work of ex-Mormons or disenchanted “inactive” Mormons living in Utah. Brooks’s ethnographic work demonstrates clearly that leavers are not necessarily already marginal, but can and do sometimes begin as “wholly committed and faithful members” of the LDS Church (2018). Brooks’ analysis resonates with the underlying stance I took both in conducting interviews and in coding the data, “viewing apostasy [sic] as an analytically rich crystallization point for analyzing underlying tensions within Mormonism,” rather than seeing leaving the LDS Church as a problem of the individual’s marginality. Importantly, recent quantitative work clearly shows that most leavers quit the LDS Church young, before they are “credentialed”, and/or they are already marginal to the LDS communities, for example, because of their politics, social lives, sexual identities, etc. (see McGraw et al. 2018; Riess 2019). Further, Riess (2019) shows that the majority of leavers switch religions. This quantitative work, combined with Brooks’s ethnography, helps explain why earlier studies of ex-Mormons found that leavers were already marginal, and points to the need to focus research on the devout, committed, “credentialed” Mormons who eventually leave. Because I assume that disaffiliation is a transformational process, full of effort that requires time, I asked how leavers become marginal in the first place. By beginning with participants who had once been fully “credentialed” Mormons, I found that marginality is neither disaffiliation itself nor an adequate explanation for disaffiliation.

The pool was designed not to be representative of ex-Mormons per se, nor to be demographically representative; rather, as a descriptive project, my goal was to achieve a breadth of experiences of leaving Mormonism from various positions of fully credentialed, devoted practice, in order to see if there were patterns, structures, or common experiences across a possible range of leaving journeys. To achieve this, I zeroed in on volunteers who self-identified as having been “true believing Mormons” and/or who had demonstrated a high level of devotion in their previous Mormon lives through tithing, church callings and volunteer work, missionary service, temple worship, obedience to the LDS health and sexual laws, etc. Interview participants ranged in age from late 20s to early 60s; they were all white; all identified as heterosexual but one; and they came from a range of economic backgrounds from working class to highly paid professionals. Of those, two participants asked to not be quoted in the final research but gave permission to be part of the coding process. Two of the men and one of the women had converted to Mormonism in their early 20s and had left Mormonism in middle age. My interview subjects were from across North America (including Canada), as well as two from the European Union (interviews were conducted in English).

First, I compared, contrasted, analyzed, and critiqued my interview data based on the notes I’d taken during four years of participation in the two online fora. Forum A was a community of people questioning their Mormon beliefs and struggling with the contradictions between their doubt and the cultural expectations within Mormon communities. Many members of Forum A continued to practice Mormonism and to identify as Mormon in their daily lives, often trying to thread the needle between unbelief and practice, or to negotiate challenging family relationships. Forum B was a community of people who were trying to reject Mormonism in some way, by ceasing practice or “coming out” to friends and family as unbelievers. Both groups contained many people who, again, matched the larger trends outlined by Riess’s recent quantitative work; they were younger, leaving early, or already-marginal to the community in significant ways. So as I memoed during interview analysis, I compared my notes from participating in these communities with the coding data as it emerged, which allowed the texture and detail of individual experiences to challenge, problematize, and reshape my earlier conceptions of leaving Mormonism, while also putting interview participants into context with these larger groups of leavers.

By expanding my lens to look for a process over time rather than an event, I found that leaving journeys for devout Mormons consisted of a series of lesser breaking points that were neither end-points nor the cause of their leaving; rather, such experiences seem far more like punctuating moments, moments of disruption, rethinking, and adjustment. In other words, formerly devout Mormons went through a series of ruptures, over time. Participants’ journeys outward, then, were more akin to evolutionary theory’s notion of punctuated equilibrium (see Eldredge and Gould 1972), where a would-be leaver had an experience that prompted a moment of reflexivity about their Mormonism or the church, including experiences of upheaval, dissonance, and necessary adjustment and change. The punctuating moment was then followed by a period of stabilization and a “new normal,” where they grew used to a new, modified view of themselves and the LDS Church and/or their Mormon practice.

Each of these categories of experience occurred at the intersection of the overall Mormon context with the leaver’s current position within Mormondom. A punctuating moment severed only those ties to Mormonism that the leaver was prepared to sever at that moment, such that over time, more and more lines were cut with each new disruption.

Participants described this epistemology as being limited by both institutional pressures within the church and by communal surveillance, that is, Mormons monitoring each other’s beliefs and levels of devotion through practice. Similarly, every participant I interviewed had come in their own way to see a moral contradiction at the heart of Mormonism. On one hand, they had been taught to live by a high ethical standard, which participants often referred to as “Christ-like love”; on the other hand, the rules of the Church and the cultural norms of Mormon communities often discouraged or made impossible compassionate and humane interaction. As these devout leavers wended their way out, they used various strategies to avoid or soften these contradictions, at various stages turning their critique inward on themselves or outward onto their fellow adherents, sometimes defensively deflecting critique away from the LDS Church itself onto a putative imperfection of practice and adherence among Mormon people. Their numerous and varied punctuating experiences ultimately cohered into an ongoing and growing immanent critique of both Mormon truth-seeking and ethics; none of the participants equivocated on these points, describing them in terms of a growing disillusionment or disappointment, which was ultimately profound and rupturing.

So I was a voracious student of everything.” These devout who left the LDS Church had to become to some degree reflexive and critical about their own knowledge, leading toward a reconstruction of their relationship to truth in overlapping tension with other ways of knowing, such as science, academic historicism, or aesthetics. Because Mormonism had taught participants that truth is revealed as a spiritual experience, through direct intervention of the Holy Ghost or Spirit of God, two different kinds of binding contradictions occurred on their outward journeys. If an individual had indeed experienced a revelation of truth in some way, when they encountered evidence that the church’s truth-claims were false, they had to resolve the contradictions between their religious experiences and their intellectual discoveries. By contrast, if they had been unable to experience a revelation of truth, they had to conclude that the promise of the Holy Ghost was “inherently, fundamentally invalid” (Aurelia, mid 30s). Socially, surveillance within Mormon communities pushed adherents to evaluate each other’s worthiness or faithfulness based on what they claimed to have experienced and to “know.” Laban (early 50s) described how his “own parents would say, ‘You’re thinking too much.... You’re so open-minded your testimony is going to fall out’ kind of thing.” Eliza (late 40s) was told both by fellow Mormons and church leaders that her doubts and questions, indeed her actual truth-seeking, were inspired by Satan to lead her away from the Church.

Seeing the non-Mormon world as benighted was often bolstered with a teaching from The Book of Mormon that “wickedness never was happiness” (Alma 41:10). Participants found this created a false perception of other people and a bulwark preventing a deep ethical critique of Mormonism, because it encouraged them to see non-or “fallen” Mormons as, by definition, sinners. They had been taught that such people could not be truly happy, making any happiness outside of Mormon contexts nothing more than an illusion (see e.g., Scott 2004). Nearly all the participants reported that their efforts to conform to Mormon communal norms led to behaviors that they later regretted as unethical. Mosiah (early 30s) explained that, if Mormon practice truly lived up to its own ethical standards, “Mormons should theoretically be the smartest, most creative, best people....” Instead, he found them to be uptight, naıve, unethical.

More specifically, their emotional words, thoughts, and feelings revealed a relationship among three different feeling contexts: what emotions had meant to them as devout Mormons, what they actually felt at a given punctuating moment, and the new role emotions played once they had made a final break with Mormonism.

In a broadly binary system, Mormon emotions give a thumbs up (true or good) or a thumbs down (false or evil) to any object of intellectual or moral evaluation. Over time, both LDS leaders and Mormon communal cultures have expanded this good/bad binary, adding more detailed descriptions of feelings and affect states and instructions on how to use emotions as a tool to reveal truth or morality (see e.g., Dallin H. Oaks 1982 or more recently the June 2014 issue of The New Era).

They described living as a NOM as exhausting, requiring too much mental, social, and personal gymnastics to get through day-to-day life among “TBMs” (true believing Mormons). I identified experimentation to be the most common method my participants used to cease practice. This was especially clear in discussions of the Word of Wisdom (Mormon health law), tithing, wearing temple garments, and the Law of Chastity. Based on personal preference, experience, curiosity, and desire, participants would pick a particular aspect of one Mormon practice to stop, and then see what happened. Nearly all participants described this experimentation process as a kind of simple relief, as the world did not end and they did not descend into misery as they sipped a whiskey, or touched their significant others under bras or belts, or didn’t wear their temple garments for a day, or went a month without tithing. These small experiments built up over time, leading to full cessation of practice for all participants, but at different speeds and with different challenges (both personal and social) along the way.

First, drawing more generalizable conclusions would require additional studies with more participants. Relatedly, my pool was focused on English-speaking and primarily North American Mormons, raising the question of what differences there might be among leavers living in the other half of the LDS world outside of North America. Second, as McGraw et al. (2018) noted, most recent studies, including my own, rely on online community sources for their data, but do not interrogate the impact or roll of online communities per se on leaving Mormonism. Because my method was interactionist on two levels—I participated in two communities for four years, and my data came from interviews and follow-ups rather than static online text—my study differs significantly from other extant work on online ex-Mormon communities. However, I also did not seek to understand the role of the Internet or of the online communities in the leaving process. My data strongly suggest, however, that the Internet fora for ex-Mormons, particularly the two I focused on, create tight, safe, supportive, and mutually reinforcing communities that serve as “home bases” for would-be leavers as they do their work of leaving and thereby facilitate the leaving process. But such community dynamics need to be studied in their own right. Finally, although it seems clear that there are key differences between the majority of ex-Mormons who were already-marginal, and those who were “credentialed,” devout adherents, I can’t help but think that a large-scale study of formerly devout ex-Mormons could be fruitfully compared to research about leavers from other high-cost religions, such as those leaving Hasidic Judaism (Davidman 2014) or Islam ","TextSize":10.000106811523438},{"Bounds":[42.51969909667969,588.5045318603516,433.66856384277344,623.1748809814453],"Font":{"alt_family_name":"Adv Titlingmes","embedded":true,"encoding":"Custom","family_name":"Adv Titlingmes","font_type":"Type1","italic":false,"monospaced":false,"name":"LBELNC+AdvTimes","subset":true,"weight":400},"HasClip":false,"Page":17,"Path":"//Document/P[66]/ParagraphSpan[2]","Text":"(Cottee 2015).

Second, to undo and remake oneself out of Mormonism takes real, concerted, conscious work—epistemological, moral, emotional, and gendered work. Participants had begun as devout, believing, fully “credentialed” Mormons, and had ended with a complete unbelief in Mormonism and full cessation of religious practice.
